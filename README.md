# Management-system-for-employees-salary

The project was developed in C# form using the TDD method.

The system allows several options for the user:

1.Admission of a single employee by manually entering the employee's details.

2.Automatic entry of 10,000 employees into the system (random).

3.Sorting all employees according to salaries and getting the time of calculation.
* The sorting of the employees was initially performed using bubble sort and then was changed to Counting sort to improve the sorting time.

4.Calculation of income tax for a selected employee from the list.
